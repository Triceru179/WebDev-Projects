# WebDev-Projects

## Some of these projects are not too relevant. Therefore, I'll just mention about some of them:

- TodoList-v2: A todo-list with basic functionality. You can add and remove items, and also create multiple lists;
- Wiki-API: A basic model of an RESTful-API. It uses HTTP request verbs and specific pattern of Routes/Endpoints URLs;
- Secrets: A website where you can post a secret anonymously. The point of this project was to learn about security features like hash, salting etc;
- Blog-with-Database: It's a blog where you can compose a post with title and content. p.s. it's the same base as of the EJS challenge, but improved with the inclusion of a database.
